# CommitAIFlow

**CommitAIFlow brings AI-driven commit best practices into your team workflow, ensuring history is clean, consistent, and collaboration is friction-free.**

---

CommitAIFlow uses AI to automatically **analyze code changes**,  
propose meaningful **atomic commit splits**, and generate **clear commit messages**.  
It helps developers keep a readable Git history while reducing the manual effort of writing and organizing commits.
